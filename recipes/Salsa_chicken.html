        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This salsa chicken Instant Pot recipe makes an easy weeknight meal even easier. Frozen chicken breasts are combined with taco seasoning and salsa for a tasty Mexican-themed meal. You can use the meat for tacos, burrito bowls, or as a topping for baked potatoes. So many possibilities! I used this the first night for chicken quesadillas. The second night I used it as a topping for baked potatoes with shredded cheese, pickled jalapeños, and sour cream.</p>
